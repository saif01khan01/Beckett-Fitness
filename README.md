Fitness app to track calories and more :) 

Final year project for my Computer science degree.

Currently the application is in Java and uses Google Firebase for various backend activities.

NOTE : If you choose to use/extend this app you will have to set up firebase with your own settings. 

To setup firebase with the latest settings please refer to the official docs here : https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup
